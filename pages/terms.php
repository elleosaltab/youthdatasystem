        <h2>Privacy Policy — RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012)</h2>
        <p class="muted">This Privacy Policy explains how Youthdatasys (“we”, “our” or “the System”) collects, uses, discloses, stores, and protects personal data in accordance with the Philippines Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) and guidelines issued by the National Privacy Commission (NPC).</p>

        <h3 class="sect">1. Data Controller &amp; Data Protection Officer (DPO)</h3>
        <p><strong>Data Controller:</strong> Youthdatasys / [Your Organization Name], responsible for processing personal data collected through the System.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Protection Officer (DPO):</strong> <br>
        Name: <strong>[DPO Name]</strong><br>
        Email: <strong>[dpo@yourdomain.ext]</strong><br>
        Phone: <strong>[+63 9XX-XXX-XXXX]</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sect">2. Personal Data We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Identification: full name, birthdate, age, gender (optional).</li>
          <li>Contact: email address, mobile number.</li>
          <li>Location: barangay, municipality, province.</li>
          <li>Account: username, password (stored as salted hash), role (Youth, SK official, Admin).</li>
          <li>SK/youth data: position, membership details, verification documents (IDs, certificates) when submitted.</li>
          <li>System logs: IP address, device info, timestamps, activity logs for security and auditing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sect">3. Legal Bases for Processing</h3>
        <p>We process personal data based on one or more of the following lawful bases, where applicable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consent — explicit consent provided by the data subject (or guardian for minors) when required.</li>
          <li>Legitimate interests — for system operation, fraud prevention, and security.</li>
          <li>Legal obligation — to comply with laws, court orders, or government requests.</li>
          <li>Performance of public task — where processing supports public functions related to SK and youth administration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sect">4. Special Protection for Minors</h3>
        <p>Because the System accommodates users who may be minors (under 18), we implement these additional safeguards:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For users under 18, parental or guardian consent is required for registration and/or submission of sensitive documents. The System will present a clear consent flow and collect guardian contact details for verification.</li>
          <li>Minors are allowed limited features until verification and guardian consent are confirmed by the DPO/authorized SK official.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sect">5. How We Use Personal Data</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Identity verification and eligibility checks for SK officials and youth members.</li>
          <li>Allow SK officials to review, approve, or reject youth registrations within the same barangay/municipality.</li>
          <li>Provide and maintain System features (dashboard, messaging, reports).</li>
          <li>Security monitoring, fraud detection, and incident response.</li>
          <li>Fulfill legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="sect">6. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We only share personal data when necessary and under appropriate safeguards:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Authorized SK Officials:</strong> Access to youth registration details is limited to SK officials within the same barangay/municipality for verification purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Cloud hosting, email, analytics, and other providers who act as processors on our behalf. We require processors to implement appropriate security and confidentiality measures.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose data to government agencies or courts when required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sect">7. Cross-border Transfers</h3>
        <p>If personal data is transferred outside the Philippines (e.g., cloud hosting), we ensure adequate safeguards are in place — such as processor agreements that require compliance with RA 10173 and appropriate security controls.</p>

        <h3 class="sect">8. Retention &amp; Disposal</h3>
        <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes listed above and to meet legal or contractual obligations. Example retention windows (adjust as needed):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Active account data: retained during the account lifecycle.</li>
          <li>Registration and verification records: retained for the duration of the SK term plus <strong>[X years]</strong> for audit and legal compliance.</li>
          <li>System logs: retained for <strong>[Y months]</strong> for security investigations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When data is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize it using industry-standard methods.</p>

        <h3 class="sect">9. Security Measures</h3>
        <p>We implement organizational, physical, and technical safeguards including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2) with salts;</li>
          <li>Role-based access control and least-privilege principles;</li>
          <li>Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for data in transit;</li>
          <li>Secure backups, regular security patching, and logging/monitoring;</li>
          <li>Periodic privacy and security training for staff with access to personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sect">10. Data Breach Notification</h3>
        <p>In case of a personal data breach that may pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, Youthdatasys will comply with NPC requirements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Notify the NPC and affected data subjects within <strong>72 hours</strong> from discovery if the breach is likely to result in real risk of harm.</li>
          <li>Provide details of the breach, affected data categories, measures taken, and contact details for inquiries (include DPO contact).</li>
          <li>Perform remediation and, where appropriate, offer mitigation (e.g., password reset, credit monitoring where applicable).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="sect">11. Data Subject Rights &amp; How to Exercise Them</h3>
        <p>Under RA 10173, data subjects have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be informed about processing activities;</li>
          <li>Access and obtain a copy of personal data;</li>
          <li>Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
          <li>Object to or restrict processing in certain situations;</li>
          <li>Erasure (right to be forgotten) where applicable;</li>
          <li>Data portability, where technically feasible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise rights, contact the DPO at <strong>[dpo@yourdomain.ext]</strong> with a clear request and proof of identity. We may require reasonable time to verify requests and will respond within applicable NPC timelines.</p>

        <h3 class="sect">12. Consent &amp; Consent Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>We obtain explicit consent where required. Registration screens and forms present a clear consent checkbox (unchecked by default) that links to this Privacy Policy. For minors, consent from a parent or guardian is required and recorded.</p>

        <h3 class="sect">13. Hosting &amp; Processors</h3>
        <p>Our System may use third-party hosting and services. Current processors include: <strong>[e.g., AWS / DigitalOcean / Local Provider]</strong>. We maintain written agreements requiring processors to implement adequate security and confidentiality measures.</p>

        <h3 class="sect">14. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be announced in the System and by updating the <em>Last updated</em> date. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.</p>
